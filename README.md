   2) Start CCS
   3) [In the top left] Go to Project->Import CCS Projects...
   4) Click "Browse..." and then browse to the workspace directory (again, something like C:\Users\Marcus\workspace_v8\)
   5) CCS should find this repository labelled "CE4000_Team_Gamma", select it and click "Finish"
   6) In the project explorer, navigate to the src folder and open main_nortos.c
   7) Try to build the project using the hammer icon (or type ctrl+B which will do the same thing)
   8) Hopefully everything went smoothly!
